# Azure Static Website with Terraform

This project shows you how to create a simple static website on Microsoft Azure using Terraform. Terraform helps you set up and manage your cloud resources with code â€” no need to click around in the Azure portal!

---

## What You Will Learn

- How to use Terraform to create Azure resources  
- How to set up an Azure Storage Account that hosts a static website  
- How to keep your cloud setup saved in code  
- How to use Git and GitHub to keep track of your project files

---

## What This Project Does

The Terraform files here create:

- An **Azure Resource Group** (a container for resources)  
- An **Azure Storage Account** with static website hosting enabled  

You can then upload your website files (like HTML and images) to the storage account and it will be available on the internet!
